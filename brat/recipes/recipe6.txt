Pierce the skin of the chicken with a fork or knife. Sprinkle with kombu tea evenly on both sides of the chicken, about 1 teaspoon per chicken thigh. Brown the skin side of the chicken first over high heat until golden brown. Sprinkle some pepper on the meat just before flipping over. Then brown the other side until golden brown.
