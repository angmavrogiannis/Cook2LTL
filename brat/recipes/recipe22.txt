Peel the potatoes and quarter. Add all ingredients to a medium saucepan and simmer until the potatoes are tender. Remove potatoes from cooking liquid and mash to desired consistency (I like mine a bit lumpy). Add a few spoonfuls of the cooking liquid and the sour cream and combine. Serve as a side with steak.
