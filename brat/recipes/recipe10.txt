Chop green onions; chop red peppers; peel and grate carrots (save two grated carrots for salads); place all in a medium bowl and toss to mix. Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Place salmon fillet in middle of a large piece of heavy aluminum foil. Sprinkle salmon with ginger and freshly ground black pepper if you wish. Arrange bowl of veggies on top of salmon, and seal foil tightly to create a tightly sealed pocket. Place in oven and bake for 20 minutes. Cook rice per package instructions. While fish bakes, prepare Salad a La SPORTZ by arranging crackers in single layer on cookie sheet; sprinkle with Parmesan topping. Bake for 1 to 2 minutes in oven with fish, just until lightly browned. Cool. Toss greens (1/2 pound = 8 cups), carrots (grated), tomatoes (halved), and green onions (sliced) in large sized bowl. Toss with dressing. Sprinkle with crackers just before serving. Slice banana and kiwi and toss gently; divide between four dessert cups. Blend cinnamon and sugar into yogurt, and place one-fourth of mixture on each bowl of fruit.
