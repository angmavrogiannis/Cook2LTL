Place vanilla wafer cookie in a baggie, seal bag and crush it into tiny pieces (I rolled a rolling pin over it). Set aside. In a blender add banana, coconut milk, half-and-half, vanilla extract, stevia and ice cubes. Put the lid on and blend until smooth. Pour into 2 cups and top each smoothie with whipped cream and crushed wafer cookie.
