Preheat the oven to 350 F. Butter or oil an 8-inch baking dish. Cook the penne 2 minutes less than package directions. Rinse the pasta in cold water and set aside. Combine the cooked pasta and the sauce in a medium bowl and mix carefully but thoroughly. Scrape the pasta into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the top with the cheeses and then the chili powder. Bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Let the mac and cheese sit for 5 minutes before serving. Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and whisk in the flour. Continue whisking and cooking for 2 minutes. Slowly add the milk, whisking constantly. Cook until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat. Add the cheeses, salt, chili powder, and garlic powder. Stir until the cheese is melted and all ingredients are incorporated, about 3 minutes. Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. Stir frequently so the sauce doesn't scorch.
