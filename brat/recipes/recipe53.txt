Peel, core and slice the apples. Combine all the filling ingredients and mix well. Cut each piece of pastry into 2 equal rectangles (about 30cm X 15cm). Put 1 piece onto a greased baking tray and place a line of filling down the center lengthwise. Brush edges with beaten egg and lay another sheet of pastry on top, pressing lightly to seal. Flatten the top slightly with your hand. Repeat apple/pastry layering process, finishing with a layer of puff. Glaze the top with beaten egg and sprinkle with extra almonds and sugar. Bake at 190C/380F for about 25 min till golden brown and crisp. Serve warm with cream and/or possibly ice-cream. A quick and easy dessert.
