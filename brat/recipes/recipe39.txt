Preheat oven to 325 degrees farenheit. Grease 3 large baking sheets. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg white and salt at medium speed until soft peaks form. Increase speed to medium-high and add sugar a tablespoon at a time, beating until all the sugar is incorporated (mixture will be thick). Stir in flour, cinnamon, vanilla and nuts. Drop mixture by level teaspoons, 1 1/2 inches apart, on prepared baking sheets. Bake 10 to 13 minutes, or until they are dry and firm on the top. Cook 1 minute on baking sheets. Transfer to racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 10 days or freeze for longer storage.
