First preheat your oven to 200C and then place a frying pan on the hob over a medium heat, add your oil or butter and then add the onion and garlic. Saute until soft and take off the heat and leave to cool. Once cool, place the onion and garlic into a bowl, along with the sausage meat and thyme and season well with salt and pepper. Mix by hand; making sure everything is incorporated well. Take a large baking tray and unroll the puff pastry over it. Along the long length of the pastry, place the sausage meat mix evenly in the middle, leaving a gap at either end. Then using a knife, carve a gully in the centre of the meat. This is for the marmalade so spoon an even amount in and then carefully press the meat together. Again with a knife, make slits in the pastry approximately 2 cms apart on either side of the meat and then starting at one end, fold each flap over, creating a plait effect and seal at both ends. Brush the egg wash all over and scatter the poppy seeds over after that. Place in the hot oven for 40 45 minutes until the pastry puffs up and browns. Serve hot or cold.
