Heat oven to 375 degrees and grease a 13x9-inch pan. Combine 1 1/2 cups oat, flour, sugar, cinnamon, soda and salt. To your dry ingredients add the juice, oil, egg and vanilla; mix well. Stir in fruit. Spread into the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with the 2 tablespoons of oats. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned and the edges start to pull away from sides of the pan. Cool completely, cut into bars and store in a covered container.
