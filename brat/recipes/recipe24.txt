Spread foie mousse on each fillet and top with 3 chives. Soak the rice wrappers in warm water until soft, about 3 minutes, then lay on a dry, clean hand towel. Place halibut, foie side down in the middle of the wrapper and fold in bottom side first. Then fold in the 2 sides followed by the top. Let rest on folded side for 5 minutes before cooking. These can be made 4 hours in advance. In a non stick pan, coat with a little oil and sear folded side first, about 3 minutes. This will seal the package. Flip over and sear the foie side until brown. Flip back over and toast in a 400 degree oven for about 8 to 10 minutes. On a large plate, place small mound of squash in the middle. Surround with mushrooms and garnish with truffle oil and chives. In a processor, puree into a mousse the foie gras, egg, cream, truffle oil and chicken until smooth. Transfer the mousse to a chilled bowl and fold in the chives and season with salt and pepper. Set aside Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees. Place squash on baking dish and add the butter, honey, ginger and seasoning. Bake for 45 to 60 minutes until squash is "al dente". Do not overcook the squash.
