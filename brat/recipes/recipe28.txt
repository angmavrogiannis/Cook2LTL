Dump crab meat into a large mixing bowl. If using lump crab meat, break up crab chunks to as small size pieces as you like. Add sour cream and cream cheese and stir until well blended. Add in the shredded cheese, bacon bits, and seasonings and stir together. Serve with tortilla chips, bagel chips, pita chips, or crackers.
