Prehear oven to 400 degrees F. Heat and stir turkey in dressing in large skillet on medium heat until warm. This can also be done in a microwave. Stir in vegetables and soup. (I dice an onion and use frozen peas, carrots, lima beans, and white corn) Spoon into greased 9-inch square baking dish; top with cheese. Unfold pastry sheet; place over turkey mixture. Fold under edges of pastry; press onto top of baking dish to seal. Brush pastry with egg. Cut several slits in pastry to allow steam to escape. Put casserole dish on baking sheet. (incase of overflow) Bake 30 minute or until crust is deep golden brown. Let stand 5 minute before serving allowing to set so when served it does not run.
