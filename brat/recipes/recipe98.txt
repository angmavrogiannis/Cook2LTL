Preheat oven to 375. Cut squashes in half and scoop out seeds. Place squashes cut side up on a cooking tray and roast until soft and a little browned (about 25 minutes). Once cooked, scoop out squash and discard the skins. Meanwhile, chop onion and garlic. Cook with olive oil over medium-high heat until soft. Add cumin, tomatoes, black beans, squash, salt and pepper and stir. Add vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes. Blend using a handheld blender or traditional blender. Garnish with avocado slices and serve.
