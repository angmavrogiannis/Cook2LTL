Cut the melon into chunks, reserving the juices. Put the melon and its juices into a blender along with the apple juice and lime juice and blend until smooth. Add the mint for just a few seconds at the end. Pour the soup into a bowl and whisk in the yogurt. Taste the soup and correct the seasonings. You may want to add more mint or perhaps a little honey.
