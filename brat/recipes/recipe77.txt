Cover the wheat berries with water and soak overnight. The next day place the wheat berries with 8 cups water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until tender, uncovered. Drain and refrigerate until completely cooled. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and fry the onion 2 minutes until soft. Add the curry paste and cook 3 more minutes Remove from heat and allow to cool. Combine the wheat berries, curry onion mixture, nuts, red pepper, mozzarella and parsley in a bowl. Whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, salt and the white wine vinegar. Add to the wheat berry salad and mix together. Serve.
