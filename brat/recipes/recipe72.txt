In a large bowl, cream together the peanut butter and sugar. Add the vanilla and salt and mix well. Now add half the milk and half the flour, and all of the baking powder. Mix very well. Add the remaining milk and flour, and mix again until the batter is nice and smooth. Turn the mixture into a well oiled 9 by 5-inch loaf pan. Bake at 350 for about an hour. Remove from the oven, and allow to cool for about 10 minutes before removing from the pan. Cool completely before wrapping and storing. These loaves freeze well.
