Prepare cucumber by cutting into 2 inch rounds. Scoop out the seeds and flesh in the centre of the cucumber using a melon baller or spoon. Be careful not to go all the way through the cup. (Place scooped cucumber into a bowl). Carve out enough of the cucumber to leave a 1/2 inch (8 mm) border, along sides and bottom. You should have 12 mini cups. Place all of the remaining ingredients in a food processor including the reserved cucumber. Puree until smooth. Adjust seasoning to taste. Add vodka and strain through a colander. Chill for 1 hour and up to overnight to develop flavor. Pour puree into cucumber cups and serve immediately.
