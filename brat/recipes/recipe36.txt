Preheat oven to 425F. Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil and spray heavily with cooking spray. Set aside. Seed the peppers and cut each pepper vertically into quarters. Stacking 2 to 3 pieces at a time, cut the peppers horizontally into 1/4 inch strips and place them in a large mixing bowl. Add the garlic and onion. Toss well. Arrange the vegetables in a single layer on a baking sheet; liberally spray them with cooking spray until they are well coated. Place the pan on a rack set in the middle of the oven. Arrange the eggplant on a second prepared baking sheet. Spray the eggplant with cooking spray until well coated. Place a large piece of foil over the eggplant, covering it loosely. Place the pan on rack set toward top of oven. Set a timer for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, stir peppers and return them to oven. Stir eggplant, turning cubes. Cover again with foil and return pan to oven. Bake both pans of vegetables another 10 minutes. Scrape the softened pepper mixture back into a large bowl; set the garlic aside. Stir the eggplant, turning the cubes. Cover it again with foil and bake for 10 minutes, until the cubes hold their shape but feel soft to the touch. Meanwhile, coarsely chop the roasted garlic; add it to the bowl of roasted peppers and onions. Add the jalapeno, cilantro, capers, currants, pine nuts and vinegar. When the eggplant is done, scrape it into a bowl. Add the salt and black pepper. Mix with a fork until the caponata is well blended and creamy. Set aside to cool. If possible, refrigerate overnight before using.
