If making your own sauce, prepare it the day before you are planning to make the meatloaf. In a large bowl, combine the first nine ingredients (everything but the lamb/beef and tzatziki sauce). Crumble lamb or beef over the mixture and combine well. Shape into a loaf and place in a greased 11x7" baking dish. Bake uncovered at 350 for 55-60 minutes or until no pink remains and a thermostat reads 160. Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Drizzle with tzatziki sauce.
