Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add fettucine pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente and drain Melt butter in a large skillet and add chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often, making sure not to burn the garlic Pour about 1/4 cup of the heavy cream into a small bow. Add the egg yolk and beat together and put aside. Pour the remaining cream into the frying pan. Increase the heat to medium-high. As the cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Slowly add the cream/egg mixture. You do not want the egg to cook. Continue beating the cream mixture until all mixed together. Add 1 cup of Parmesan cheese and continue to mix the cream. Pour in remaining Parmesan and parsley and mix until smooth. Immediately remove from stove. Serve over cooked pasta.
