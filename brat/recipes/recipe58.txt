If not filling the crust, preheat oven to 400 degrees. If youre going to fill the crust, follow your recipe directions, add the filling, and baking accordingly. Place all the ingredients into a 9 pie pan. Stir together with a fork. Pat the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Poke holes into the bottom and sides of the crust (if you are not filling it). Bake for 15 minutes in a preheated oven or until golden brown. Fill as desired. (I used this recipe to make a pumpkin pie, filling and baking it. It came out great.)
