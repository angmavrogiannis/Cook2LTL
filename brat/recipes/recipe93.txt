Cook lamb strips over high heat in a hot, lightly greased wok or frying pan, 2 minutes or until browned. Remove meat and set aside. Add a little extra oil if needed. Add onion and vegetables and cook over high heat, 3 - 4 minutes until just tender. Return lamb to the pan and pour in dressing and olives. Toss so as to heat through. Do not boil. Remove to serving plate and serve immediately, generously topped with chopped herbs and grilled focaccia.
