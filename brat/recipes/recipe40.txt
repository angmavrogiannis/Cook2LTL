Preheat oven to 350F and line baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine flour, oats, sugar and parsley. In separate bowl, combine egg, oil, apple and carrot. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture, slowly adding water and kneading until a dough forms. *If dough is too sticky, add more flour. Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface to 1/4" thick and cut out shapes. Knead scraps together, roll out, cut out shapes, and repeat until all dough is used. Place on baking sheet and bake for 40-45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave in oven for 20 minutes to allow bones to dry out and crisp.
