Heat oil in large pan. Saute onions and garlic until soft. Add Pumpkin and cook for 5 minutes. Mix in curry powder and cook for another few minutes to take the rawness of the spices. Add stock and coconut milk enough to cover the vegetables and bring to a gentle boil. Simmer until pumpkin is soft, about 15 minutes. When cooked turn off heat and allow to cool slightly, blend until smooth, return to pan and add more stock until the required consistency is reached. Add the smoke salmon, the heat left in the soup will 'cook' the salmon. Check seasoning. I freeze this in batches with or without the salmon, either way its great. Once defrosted re-heat and add salmon if needed. I don't know how much this makes 8 + depending on the size of your soup bowls.
