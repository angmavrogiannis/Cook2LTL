Pour marinade over steak in resealable plastic bag. Seal bag; turn to evenly coat steak with dressing. Refrigerate at least 30 min. to marinate. Meanwhile, preheat grill to medium heat. Remove steak from marinade; discard bag and marinade. Grill steak 13 to 16 mins or until medium doneness (160F), turning occasionally. Meanwhile, steam asparagus 8 to 10 mins or until crisp-tender. Cut steak into thin strips. Place 1 to 2 steak strips and about 2 asparagus spears on each tortilla strip; roll up. Secure with frilled toothpicks or red bell pepper ties, if desired. Serve warm.
