Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. For the filling, in a large bowl, combine the potatoes, 1 cup of the sugar, the butter, eggs, vanilla, salt, and spices. Mix thoroughly. Add the milk, stirring well. Pour the mixture into the pie crust and bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Place the pie on a rack and cool to room temperature before covering with meringue. For the meringue, using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form; beat in the remaining A cup sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. Continue beating until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is glossy and stiff, but not dry. With a rubber spatula, spoon the meringue onto the pie, forming peaks. Make sure the meringue touches the crust all around. Sprinkle with a pinch of granulated sugar. Bake for 5 to 10 minutes, or until delicately browned. Cool and serve.
