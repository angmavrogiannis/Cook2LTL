Stir yeast into 1/2 cup warm water, allow to foam-up for 10 minutes. Pour yeast mixture to all remaining ingredients and add just enough water to mix dough, but not too sticky. Mix all ingredients together, knead thoroughly. Divide into four pieces and place in oiled bowl or pot, and cover with lid or towel. Allow dough to rise 30-mins. knead each of the 4 dough balls again, and return them to the bowl/pot to rise another 30-mins. Using 1/4 at a time, knead dough ball one last time, then cut dough into pieces that can be rolled into about a 5 rope. Make a circle of the rope and use your baby finger to make an indentation where the ends join. Set on a blanket covered table that has been covered with a clean white sheet. Gradually cover rows of doughnut shaped rounds with the sheet when all are arranged on table, cover also with the blanket. Let rise until doubled in size. Bake in a 350 oven for about 15 minutes, or until they start to firm up, but not turn brown yet. Split each circle in half (like a bagel) while still hot using a fork to pierce the doughnut shape all around the middle. Separate and return to oven at 375 or 400 . Toast until brown.
