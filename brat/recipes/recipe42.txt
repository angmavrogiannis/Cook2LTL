Grease a 13 x 9-inch baking dish. In a large saucepan, saute the onion in oil until tender (about 3-4 minutes). In a bowl, combine all remaining ingredients including the lemon slices (except the sausages) mix well to combine, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered for about 20-25 minutes, or until slightly thickened (stirring occasionally). Remove the lemon slices and discard. Place the sausages or hot dogs in the baking dish. Top with sauce, and mix slightly to combine. Bake in a 350 degrees oven, uncovered for about 20-25 minutes, or until heated through. Keep warm when serving.
