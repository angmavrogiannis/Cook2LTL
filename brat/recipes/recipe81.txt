Toss meat with 2 Tbsp  of the steak sauce; let stand 10 min  to marinate. Meanwhile, combine remaining 2 Tbsp  steak sauce, the barbecue sauce and mustard; set aside. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Thread meat onto eight long metal or soaked wooden skewers. Grill skewers 6 min  or until meat is cooked through, turning after 3 min  and brushing frequently with the barbecue sauce mixture.
