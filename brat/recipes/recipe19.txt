Saute the onions, carrots, celery with olive oil by gradually adding half cup of water until soft. Add to the saute onions, diced tomatoes, hot red pepper powder and stir for five minutes; add 3 cups of water, leave it to boil. Rinse the lentils with cold water. To the boiling sauce, add lentils, ginger juice, white pepper and two cups of vegetable broth; reduce the heat to medium; cook for 30 minutes or until the lentils are very soft. Using a cooking stick, puree the soup in its pot or transfer to a food processor, blend the lentils until smooth; and bring it back to its saucepan. Add the rest of the vegetable broth or water as need; then in a lower heat stir the soup for 10 minutes. Add salt and black pepper. Remove from heat. Garnish it with fresh parsley, basil or cheese of your choice. Serve it hot or cold. Keep it in the fridge.
