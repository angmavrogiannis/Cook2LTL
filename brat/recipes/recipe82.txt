Preheat oven to 500F (yes, 500F! ). Grate the potatoes and onions on the middle sized hole of a grater; either by hand or by food processor. If you grate the potatoes and onions together, the potatoes will not turn grey right away. Put into a large bowl or soup pot, and mix well with remaining ingredients. Grease your baking pans, and pour mixture evenly into the pans. Bake for 15 minutes at 500F, then lower the oven to 400F until done (check after an hour or so; it should be golden brown on top). Eat and enjoy.
