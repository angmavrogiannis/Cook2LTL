Cook linguine according to package directions; drain. Saute bell pepper in a small skillet over medium heat until limp, about 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl; slowly whisk in oil. Stir in 1/2 cup of basil. Place pasta, chicken, cooked peppers, mozzarella, goat cheese, and remaining basil in a large bowl. Pour dressing over top and toss to coat. Serves 4. Note: when I make this, I put a couple of uncooked chicken breasts, sprinkled with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, under the broiler while everything else is being prepared.
