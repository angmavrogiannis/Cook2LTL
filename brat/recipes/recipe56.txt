Place a cup of rice, cooled to just above room temperature, in the bottom of each of 6 bowls, and add a layer of the avocado slices, distributing evenly in any pattern you choose. Sprinkle a pinch or two of salt over each bowl. Add the raw matchstick vegetables in an even, randomly arranged layer, and sprinkle on the nori confetti. Add the fish on top, arranging as you wish, perhaps in twists or rolls. Scatter scallions and sesame seeds on top. Serve with condiments like soy sauce, wasabi, pickled ginger and rice vinegar, so diners can season and toss sushi with chopsticks or spoons.
