Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Flatten dough onto a pan into a rectangle. Don't handle the dough too much or it'll start to tear. Allow to warm up to room temperature. In a medium-sized pan, brown sausage. Drain well. Pour sausage evenly in a line in the center of the dough. Sprinkle cheese evenly on top of sausage. Sprinkle Italian Seasoning and Garlic Salt over the top of the sausage and cheese. (Optional). Pull the two longer sides together and close it up as best you can then do the same with the two smaller ends. Using a SMALL amount of olive oil, coat the top of the dough then sprinkle Garlic Salt and Italian Seasoning over the top. Put the bread into the oven for 30-45 minutes. If you flick the bread and it sounds hollow, then it's done. Heat the sauce in a medium sauce pan with a lid on top. Cool, Serve and Enjoy. -May also be made with green peppers and onions, or any other concoction you can think of.
